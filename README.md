# EDA on Mobile Price Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of mobile phones to understand the factors affecting their price ranges. The goal is to uncover insights, visualize patterns, and identify relationships between different mobile features and pricing.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features of mobile phones such as:
- `battery_power` – Total energy in mAh
- `ram` – Random Access Memory in MB
- `mobile_wt` – Weight of mobile
- `px_height` & `px_width` – Pixel resolution of the mobile
- `price_range` – Price category (0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High, 3: Very High)
- And other specifications like touchscreen, camera quality, etc.
  
## Key Objectives
- Perform **Univariate Analysis** to understand individual feature distributions.
- Perform **Bivariate Analysis** to find relationships between features.
- Use **visualizations** to interpret data effectively and derive meaningful insights.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Programming language used for analysis
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For documenting and running the analysis
  
## Key Learnings
- Identified which mobile features have the most impact on price classification.
- Gained experience in **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**.
- Developed skills in storytelling through data insights.
